Dependency checking
===================

If the dependencies of any files change for either the web app or extension,
run::

  ./closure-library/closure/bin/build/depswriter.py --root_with_prefix="js ../../../js" > js/deps.js


Linting
=======

The `Closure Linter`_ can be used for linting JS code to verify it follows
proper form. Assuming the linter is installed, run::

  gjslint -r js

Compilation Warnings
====================

Thanks to JSDoc markup, using the `Closure Compiler`_ will output warnings and
errors about various issues it is able to check. To do this you need to have
downloaded the Closure Compiler and placed it at
``#/compiler.jar``.

With the compiler in place, simply run ``scons`` and the compiler will be run
with VERBOSE warnings to help detect errors.
