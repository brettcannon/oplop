CLI (Command Line Interface) and reference implementation of Oplop
==================================================================

Using a single master password and various nicknames, one can create an
infinite number of unique account passwords. These unique account passwords are
commonly called password hashes, domain-specific passwords, or per-site
passwords.

The CLI implementation of Oplop is only one of many implementations. See the
`project home page <http://code.google.com/p/oplop/>`__ for the complete list
of available implementations of Oplop.
